## Overview

Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?
You can see the demo [here](https://country-quiz-react-axios.netlify.app/)

- What was your experience?

It was tough at first, but I learned a lot about React and TypeScript.

- What have you learned/improved?

I learned a lot of React Context and how to use it. I kept practicing my TypeScript skills and I'm getting better at it.
I also kept using custom hooks and I'm getting better at those too.

- Your wisdom?
I recommend using a state management library like Redux or MobX or a light weight one like zustand. I used React Context and it was a bit of a headache.
